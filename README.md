# pick-a-champ
Something to help you pick a champion for a ranked match

- User provides list of champions they are comfortable playing (you do or you don't-- if you don't then just provides a list of champions)
- User also provides list of champions on enemy team
- User also provides list of banned champions

Uses Riot Games API to:
- find out winrates against champions on enemy team
- find out winrates synergizing with champions on your team
- makes sure list of banned champions eliminated from final result
- compile the average score/winrate and sort by that.


- start with web app
- after that's finished make an in game overlay app so players can get champ list in real time
